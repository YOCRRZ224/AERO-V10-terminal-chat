## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Setting up the chat application is straightforward. You'll need Python 3 and `pip` installed.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+:** Ensure Python is installed on both your server and client devices.
* **Termux (for Android devices):** If you're using an Android phone or TV, install Termux from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) or the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux).
* **Internet Connection:** Required for package installation and server/client communication.

### Step-by-Step Installation

Follow these steps on **both** your **Server Device (e.g., Android TV)** and your **Client Device (e.g., Mobile Phone)**.

1.  **Update Termux (if on Android):**
    ```bash
    pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
    ```

2.  **Install Essential System Packages:**
    ```bash
    pkg install python openssl git make
    ```
    * `openssl`: Crucial for secure connections and Python's SSL module.
    * `make`: Required by some Python package build processes.
    * `git`: For easy cloning of this repository.

3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOCRRZ224/Terminal-chat-with-file-sharing-under-development-
    ```
    *(If you've been directly creating files, just `cd` into your existing project directory.)*

4.  **Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment:**
    It's always best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv my_chat_env
    source my_chat_env/bin/activate
    ```
    You should see `(my_chat_env)` at the beginning of your prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

5.  **Install Required Python Libraries:**
    With your virtual environment active, install `websockets`.
    ```bash
    pip install websockets
    ```

6.  **Create `downloads` Directory:**
    This directory will be used for saving received files.
    ```bash
    mkdir downloads
    ```

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### 1. Configure the Client

Before starting, you need to tell your **client** where the server is located.

* Open `terminal_chat_client.py` on your **Client Device** (e.g., Mobile Phone) with a text editor (`nano terminal_chat_client.py`).
* Locate the `HOST` variable near the top:
    ```python
    HOST = '127.0.0.1' # <-- Change this to your servers  IP address
    ```
* **Change `'127.0.0.1'` to the actual local IP address of your Server Device (e.g., Android TV).** You can usually find your TV's IP in its Wi-Fi settings (e.g., `192.168.1.105`). If both server and client are on the same device, `127.0.0.1` is correct.
* Save the file.

### 2. Start the Server

On your **Server Device** (e.g., your server device u will use):

* Open Termux.
* Activate your virtual environment: `source my_chat_env/bin/activate`
* Navigate to your project directory.
* Run the server:
    ```bash
    server.py
    ```
    The server will print a message indicating it's started (e.g., `[SERVER] Starting chat server on ws://0.0.0.0:12345`).

    > **Tip for Android TV:** If you're running the server for extended periods, consider using `termux-wake-lock` in a separate Termux session to prevent the device from sleeping and stopping the server.
    > ```bash
    > termux-wake-lock
    > ```

### 3. Start the Client

On your **Client Device** (e.g., Mobile Phone):

* Open Termux.
* Activate your virtual environment: `source my_chat_env/bin/activate`
* Navigate to your project directory.
* Run the client:
    ```bash
    client.py
    ```
    The client will attempt to connect to the server and print a welcome message.

### 4. Chat and Collaborate!

Once connected, you can start sending messages and using commands!

## üí° Commands

Here are the commands you can use in the chat:

* `/nick <new_name>`: Change your username.
    * **Example:** `/nick MyAwesomeName`
* `/list`: Display a list of all currently connected users.
* `/file <recipient_username> <local_file_name_with_extension>`: Initiate a file transfer to another user.
    * **Example:** `/file Alice my_document.pdf`
    * The recipient will be prompted with `[FILE TRANSFER] <sender> wants to send '<file_name>'...`
    * Recipient can then type `/accept <file_id>` or `/reject <file_id>`.
* `/help`: Show a comprehensive list of all available commands.
* `@username message`: Tag a user in your message.
    * **Example:** `Hey @Bob, are you there?`
    * The tagged user will receive a private server notification.
    * If you are the tagged user, `@YOURUSERNAME` will be **highlighted in yellow** in the chat message.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting / Common Issues

* **`No module found name websockets`**:
    * **Reason:** The `websockets` library is not installed in your current Python environment (likely the virtual environment).
    * **Solution:** Activate your virtual environment (`source my_chat_env/bin/activate`) and run `pip install websockets`. Ensure this is done on *both* the server and client devices.
* **`Connection refused` / Client cannot connect**:
    * **Reason 1:** The server is not running, or its IP address/port is incorrect.
    * **Solution 1:** Double-check that `terminal_chat_server.py` is running on your server device.
    * **Reason 2:** The `HOST` IP address in your `terminal_chat_client.py` is incorrect or doesn't match the server's IP.
    * **Solution 2:** Verify the server device's local IP address and update the `HOST` variable in `terminal_chat_client.py` accordingly.
    * **Reason 3:** Firewall issues on the server device or network.
    * **Solution 3:** Ensure no firewalls are blocking port `12345` on your server device.
* **`SSLError` during `pip install`**:
    * **Reason:** Python's SSL module is not correctly configured or linked against necessary system libraries, common in minimalist environments like Termux.
    * **Solution:** Install OpenSSL development libraries and ensure Python is correctly linked:
        ```bash
        pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
        pkg install openssl libssl-dev
        pkg install python # This might re-link Python with updated SSL libs
        # Then retry your pip install command
        ```
* **File Transfer Issues**:
    * Ensure the local file path you're trying to send exists and is accessible.
    * Verify the `downloads` directory exists on the receiving client's device.
    * Confirm both sender and receiver are running the **latest code** with file transfer logic.

## üìà Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

* **Persistent Chat History:** Save messages to a file or database.
* **Private Messaging:** Implement `/msg` or `/dm` for one-on-one conversations.
* **Emoji Support:** Basic emoji rendering.
* **Configurable Settings:** Allow users to set colors, notification preferences, etc.
* **File Transfer Progress Bar:** More visual feedback during large file transfers.
* **Server Admin Commands:** Kick/ban users, announce messages.
